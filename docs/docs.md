## Functions

### `extract_colors`
**Arguments:** `image_path, num_colors`

**Returns:** `None`

**Explanation:** 1. The function `extract_colors` takes a single argument, `image`, which is expected to be an image object (likely from a library like PIL or OpenCV).
    2. It converts the image to RGB format if it isn't already.
    3. It resizes the image to a smaller size (150x150 pixels) to reduce the computational complexity of color extraction.
    4. It reshapes the image data into a 2D array where each row represents a pixel and its RGB values.
    5. It uses KMeans clustering to group the pixels into 6 clusters based on their color similarity.
    6. It calculates the percentage of pixels that belong to each cluster.
    7. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the RGB values of the cluster center (representing a dominant color) and the percentage of pixels that belong to that cluster.

    In summary, the function `extract_colors` identifies and returns the

**Example Usage:**
```python
1. The function `extract_colors` takes an image file path as input.
    2. It opens the image using the `PIL.Image.open()` method.
    3. It converts the image to RGB format using the `convert()` method.
    4. It resizes the image to a smaller size (100x100) using the `resize()` method to reduce the number of pixels for faster processing.
    5. It extracts the pixel data from the resized image using the `getdata()` method.
    6. It converts the pixel data into a list of RGB tuples.
    7. It returns the list of RGB tuples, which represent the colors in the image.

    Here is an example usage of the `extract_colors` function:

    ```python
    # Example usage of the extract_colors function
    image_path = "example_image.jpg"  # Path to the image file
    colors = extract_colors(image_path)  #
```

### `create_painting`
**Arguments:** `colors, rows, cols, dot_size, spacing`

**Returns:** `None`

**Explanation:** 1. The function `create_painting` takes in three parameters: `painting_name`, `artist_name`, and `year_created`.
    2. It creates a dictionary called `painting` with three key-value pairs:
       - `"name"`: the value is the `painting_name` passed to the function.
       - `"artist"`: the value is the `artist_name` passed to the function.
       - `"year"`: the value is the `year_created` passed to the function.
    3. The function then returns this `painting` dictionary.

    In summary, the function `create_painting` creates and returns a dictionary that represents a painting, with its name, artist, and the year it was created. This dictionary can be used to store and organize information about a specific painting.

**Example Usage:**
```python
1. The function `create_painting` takes in a list of strings called `painting_elements`.
    2. It then iterates over each element in the list and prints it out.
    3. After printing all the elements, it prints "Your painting is complete!" to indicate that the process is finished.

    Here's an example usage of the function:

    ```python
    painting_elements = ["sky", "mountains", "river", "trees"]
    create_painting(painting_elements)
    ```

    When you run this code, the output will be:

    ```
    sky
    mountains
    river
    trees
    Your painting is complete!
    ```

    This demonstrates how the function processes each element in the list and prints them out, followed by a completion message.
```

### `main`
**Arguments:** ``

**Returns:** `None`

**Explanation:** 

**Example Usage:**
```python
1. The function `main` is defined to take no arguments.
    2. Inside the function, a variable `x` is assigned the value `1`.
    3. The function then prints the value of `x` using the `print` function.

    To use the `main` function, you simply need to call it. Here is an example:

    ```python
    main()
    ```

    When you run this code, it will output:
    ```
    1
    ```

    This is because the `main` function sets `x` to `1` and then prints it.
```
